        <p>When you buy something, Milo automatically tops off your purchase (to the next whole dollar) and deposits the "extra" into your college account.</p>
        <p>For example, you hit Starbucks for a Grande Soy Latte for $4.55. milo tops off your purchase to $5.00 and safely and securely deposits 45 cents into your education account. That's it. You won't even feel it, but over time, the money piles up.</p>
        <p>If that's not enough, just for shopping at your favorite stores you'll receive rewards from our Brand Partners like matching round-up contributions and discounts on awesome products and services!</p>
        <p>Parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, friends can use Milo to invest in the future of the kids in their lives.</p>
