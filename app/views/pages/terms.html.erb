Your use of any accounts or debit cards made available through our Services are subject to the separate terms and conditions applicable to those accounts and cards. Further, your access to and use of our Milo Platform is subject to our Privacy Policy as in effect from time to time, the current version of which is at <a href="http://milosavings.com/privacy">http://milosavings.com/privacy</a>.</p>

FURTHER, THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAIN AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, WHICH REQUIRES THAT YOU AND MILO ARBITRATE CERTAIN CLAIMS BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF GOING TO COURT AND LIMITS CLASS ACTION CLAIMS, (SEE "AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE").</p>
        <p>YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT MILO, INC. IS NOT A BANK, NOR IS IT A FINANCIAL PLANNER, BROKER OR ASSET MANAGER. THE MILO PLATFORM IS MERELY A TOOL TO ASSIST YOU IN YOUR FINANCIAL PLANNING AND DECISION-MAKING. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR SAVINGS, INVESTMENT AND SPENDING DECISIONS.</p>

Together with our goals and rules this collectively is your "User Profile". You are responsible for protecting your Login Credentials from unauthorized use, and you are responsible for all activity that occurs on your account (including without limitation financial obligations). You agree to notify us immediately if you believe that your Login Credentials have been or may be used without your permission so that appropriate action can be taken. We are not responsible for losses or damage caused by your failure to safeguard your Login Credentials.

The funds held by Milo in such account for your benefit are referred to herein as your "Milo Account". You will not be entitled to any interest or other earnings that may accrue with respect to the funds held on your behalf by Milo, and you hereby irrevocably assign and transfer to Milo any right or interest that you may have therein.

These transactions will be either initiated in the Milo App by you ("Manual Transfers") or initiated in the Milo app based on "Rules" you've set up in the App. The frequency and amount of these ACH credit and/or debit transactions will be determined by your Manual Transfers or your Rules. Periodic ACH transactions will be generated by the Milo App to move funds from your Funding Source to your Savings Account based on "Savings" that arise from Milo applying the Rules you've established. Manual Transfers will be processed when authorized by your entry.</p>
        <p>You understand that this authorization will remain in full force and effect until you notify Milo that you wish to revoke this authorization. You understand that Milo requires at least 3 business days' prior notice in order to cancel this authorization.</p>
        <h6>Funding Source Verification</h6>
        <p>The Funding Source verification process is in place to ensure a Funding Source is compatible with Milo and supports ACH transfers; to prevent Users' goals from being disclosed to unknown funding sources; and to verify external Funding Source account ownership.</p>
        <p>One of two methods are used to verify Funding Source: 1) To successfully verify a funding source, two small credit transactions will be sent for processing to the external Funding Source. The amounts of those credits will then be immediately debited out of the Funding Source. Users will need to verify the external Funding Source by entering the deposit amounts in the required fields provided in their Milo Account. Users will be responsible for any fees or penalties assessed by a financial institution that may occur by validating this funding source or 2) the external funding source will be accessed by our data integration partner and ownership and ACH support will be verified.</p>
        <h6>Shared Goals</h6>
        <p>Milo provides its Users with the ability to share their respective savings goals and send messages between Users sharing the same savings goal. Where you share your savings goals through use of the Milo Platform, all Users sharing that specific savings goal will have the ability to view the total saved by others sharing that savings goal as well as the transaction detail of money saved toward that savings goal. You agree that in inviting others to share one of your goals that others sharing that savings goal will be able to view the amount of your savings, solely as it applies to that savings goal.

Third party services are used to: verify your identity, speed up and streamline on-boarding, processing of savings transactions and data aggregation.

They will use this information in order to verify your identity and retrieve your financial data for aggregation. Milo may employ different or additional third parties for these Services. Milo does not review the information retrieved from third parties. Milo is not responsible for the timeliness or accuracy of the data provided by such third parties.

        <h6>Governing Law and Forum for Disputes</h6>
        <p>These Terms of Service, and your relationship with Milo under these Terms of Service, shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of law principles. Any dispute with Milo, or its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates, arising under or in relation to these Terms of Service shall be resolved exclusively through arbitration as set forth in the Section below, except with respect to imminent harm requiring temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in which case Milo may seek such relief in any court with jurisdiction over the parties. You understand that, in return for agreement to this provision, Milo is able to offer the Service at the terms designated. Your assent to this provision is an indispensable consideration to these Terms of Service.</p>
        <h6>Agreement to Arbitrate</h6>
        <p>Except for disputes relating to your or Milo's intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); you agree that all disputes between You and Milo (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service, the Milo Platform, the Services, and/or Privacy Policy shall be finally resolved by arbitration before a single arbitrator conducted in the English language in New York, New York, U.S.A. under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and you and Milo hereby expressly waive trial by jury. You and Milo shall appoint as sole arbitrator a person mutually agreed by you and Milo or, if you and Milo cannot agree within thirty (30) days of either party's request for arbitration, such single arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA upon the request of either party. The parties shall bear equally the cost of the arbitration (except that the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with the arbitration in such an amount as may be determined by the arbitrator). All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding this, application may be made to any court for a judicial acceptance of the award or order of enforcement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Milo shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, security or other equitable remedies from the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York or any other court of competent jurisdiction. Under no circumstances shall the arbitrator be authorized to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Service or to award punitive damages, including but not limited to pursuant to federal or state statutes permitting multiple or punitive awards.</p>
        <p>Any claims brought by You or Milo must be brought in that party's individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Neither You nor Milo will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by these Terms of Service. You hereby waive any and all rights to bring any claims related to these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. You may bring claims only on Your own behalf.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any change to the arbitration procedures set forth herein (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Milo prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate the arbitration procedures from these Terms of Service, such termination shall not be effective until 30 days after the version of these Terms of Service not containing the arbitration procedures is posted to the Website, and shall not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Milo prior to the effective date of removal.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>These Arbitration provisions will survive the termination of Your relationship with Milo.</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Enforceability</h6>
        <p>If any portion of these Terms of Service is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, these Terms of Service as a whole shall not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of these Terms of Service that is unlawful, void or unenforceable shall be stricken from these Terms of Service.</p>
        <p>You agree that if Milo does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in these Terms of Service, this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Milo's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Milo.</p>
        <p>All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made in these Terms of Service shall survive your acceptance of these Terms of Service and the termination of these Terms of Service.</p>
        <p>These Terms of Service represent the entire understanding and agreement between you and Milo regarding the subject matter of the same, and supersede all other previous agreements.</p>
